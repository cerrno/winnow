## Our Detection
- Preprocessing
> "It does this by preprocessing the source code files, calculating a numeric
> fingerprint for each file, and then performing a longest common sequence
> search on the two fingerprints. The preprocessing stage replaces all function
> and variable names with a single token, and removes all comments and
> whitespace from the source code. The fingerprint stage calculates hash values
> for windows of characters in the resulting file, preserving the lowest hash
> values as the fileâ€™s fingerprint" [Engels et al. 2007][engels-paper]
1. Remove comments and whitespace
2. Tokenize and replace function names, syntax decorators, and variable names

- Positional information (file/line number/commit) stored with each fingerprint
1. First step builds map from fingerprints => locations for all documents
(inverted index)
2. Each document is fingerprinted a second time (**why?**) and the selected fingerprints
are looked up in the index
    - now have a list of all matching fingerprints for each document
    - list of matching fingerprints for a document d may contain fingerprints
      from many other docs d1, d2, ...
3. List of matching fingerprints for each doc d is sorted by document and the
matches for each pair of docs (d, d1), (d, d2), ... is formed. Matched b/w docs
are rank-ordered by size (number of fingerprints) (largest matched reported to
user)
    - Up until step (3), no condsideration of pairs of docs is required
      (O(N^2)).
    - By postponing the quadratic computation to the last step, we can
      optimize it by never materializing the matching for a pair of documents if it
      falls below some user-specified threshold.

## Questions
1. Why fingerprint a second time in step (2)?
2. How to define our 'global location' (file/line-number/commit?)
3. How to select winnowing window size/ngram size? (I think it discusses in the paper)
4. Why to tokenize/replace function names etc. for preprocessing?
